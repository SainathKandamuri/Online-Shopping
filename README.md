ShopNest - Your Online Store
ShopNest is a simple, single-page online shopping website built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a basic e-commerce flow, including product browsing, adding items to a cart, providing shipping details, a mock payment process, and a thank you page. It also includes "About Us" and "Contact" informational pages.

How to Run Locally
Save the file: Save the provided HTML code into a file named index.html on your computer.

Open in Browser: Open the index.html file using any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

That's it! The website is self-contained and runs directly in your browser.

Project Structure
The project consists of a single index.html file which contains:

HTML Markup: Defines the layout and content for all sections (landing, cart, shipping, payment, thank you, about us, contact).

CSS Styling: Inline <style> block for custom scrollbar and a link to the Tailwind CSS CDN for utility classes.

JavaScript Logic: All application logic is contained within a single <script> block at the end of the body.

Future Enhancements (Ideas)
Backend Integration: Connect to a real backend for persistent data storage, actual payment processing, and user authentication.

Product Search/Filtering: Implement functionality to search or filter products.

User Accounts: Allow users to create accounts, save addresses, and view order history.

Order Tracking: Add a feature for users to track their orders.

More Product Details: Create individual product detail pages.

Shopping Cart Persistence: Save cart items using local storage or a backend so they persist across sessions.

Advanced UI/UX: Implement animations, transitions, and more interactive elements for a richer user experience.
